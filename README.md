# ReverseArrayChallenge
Application helps to reverse elements of Array

To reverse the array, you have to swap the elements, so that the first element is swapped with the last element and so on.

For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the reversed array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

The application should first print out the newly passed in array as Array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

and then once it's been reversed, print it out as Reversed array = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

TIP: When swapping the elements, use a variable to temporarily hold the current element.
